* option to use BASE_ARCH instead of TRUE_HOST for build dir name

Done:
* pfinit/import
* make sure .version_file in src_usr have precedence over src_ref
* pf scripts should check if it's ok to run in PWD
* refactor s.dependencies.pl
* pfmv

Special files:
* .restricted: whitelist of "$BASE_ARCH:" or "$EC_ARCH:" for dir access; located in src_ref, src dir to restrict; NOT recursive
* .version_file: whitelist of version files to produce; located in main src_ref, src dir of a component, version files are created in the component's include dir
* .rm.NAME: removed file (do not use src_ref version); location same src dir as where fiel was; NOT working for dir
